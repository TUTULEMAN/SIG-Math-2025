# SIG Math Fall 2025

This is the repository for ACM's SIG Math for Fall 2025 focusing on solving Partial Differential Equations with Physics Informed Neural Netowrks.

## Gallery
This section will be holding the benchmarks of the trained models as we moving throughtout the semester

## Contributing guide 
If you are interesting in contributing to this. Feel free to ping on the SIG Math channel your GitHub ID and you will be added as a member.

Once you are a member, you can clone, work and make pull requests to the repo as follows: (This requires [git](https://git-scm.com/install/) to be installed and working locally).

Open the terminal at the directory (folder) where you want to download the code:
- <b> Cloning the repository: </b> Run `git clone https://github.com/acm-uic/SIG-Math-2025.git`
- <b> Move into the cloned repo:</b> `cd SIG-Math-2025` 
- <b> Make your own branch: </b> `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

From here, you should be able to make your local change as see fit and when you are ready to have your code be part of the repo. Do
```
git add .
git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"
git push
```
and create a [pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Next steps 
Feel free to tackle any of the PINN models listed or develop one of your own. We do not have to be limited to this however, if you have a more novel way to approach setting up problems like analyzing data to calibrate parameters instead of using static ones, you are free to develop and suggest it and of course, contribute!
